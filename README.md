## About Me

I graduated from the Department of Anthropology at Sun Yat-sen University with my PhD, and I once spent a year of further study at Indiana University Birmington as a visiting scholar. My research interests are in development anthropology and sociology of public goods. In development anthropology, I focus on three sub-branches: 1) youth studies; 2) rural development studies; and 3) alternative education studies in rural China.Currently I am working on two main projects: the first is a study of rural social change from the perspective of rural gentrification; the second is an anthropological study of digital monthly giving. Thank you for visiting my academic webpage. If you are interested in my research, you can click the email link on the left to communicate with me, thank you!
